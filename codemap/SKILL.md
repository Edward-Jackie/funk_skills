  Generate a CODEMAP.md file that supplements CLAUDE.md with task-based file indexes, parallel call chain diagrams, and core business module summaries.
  Use this skill when: running /init on a codebase; user asks "where do I change X", "how does Y work", "show me the call flow", "梳理代码结构", "代码关系图", "调用链"; starting work on an unknown codebase; reviewing architecture before making changes; CLAUDE.md exists but you need deeper navigation into business logic.
  Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions understanding code structure, architecture diagrams, call graphs, task-based navigation, or wants a visual map of how the codebase is organized — even if they don't explicitly name this skill.
  This is NOT a CLAUDE.md replacement. CLAUDE.md covers commands, conventions, and project overview. CODEMAP.md covers: "to do task X, edit these files", "here's how data flows through the system", "these are the core business modules and what they do".

# Code Map — Supplement CLAUDE.md with Navigation Maps

Generate `CODEMAP.md` that helps Claude (and developers) quickly locate code for specific tasks and understand core business data flows. This is a **supplement to CLAUDE.md**, not a replacement — do not duplicate project overview, commands, or conventions that belong in CLAUDE.md.

## Design Principles

1. **Task-first navigation**: "To do X, edit these files" — developers (and AI) search by task, not by module
2. **Parallel call chains via Mermaid**: Text can't show parallel branches well — use Mermaid subgraphs to show concurrent flows
3. **Core modules, concise**: Each business module gets ≤ 3 lines: responsibility, key files, key functions
4. **CLAUDE.md aware**: Read CLAUDE.md first, skip what it already covers, only add new navigation-level content
5. **Function-name anchors, never line numbers**: Reference code as `file path + function/symbol name` only — **do not store line numbers**. A line number is a *derived, decaying* value: it's meaningless the moment code moves and it fails *silently* (points you at the wrong line, no error). The symbol name is stable and greppable. When you actually want a line to jump to, compute it **fresh** with `scripts/where.sh <file> <symbol>` rather than trusting a stored number.

## Process

### Step 0: Check for CLAUDE.md

If `CLAUDE.md` exists in the project root (check `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`), read it first. Note what sections it already covers (project overview, commands, conventions, tech stack). When generating CODEMAP.md, **do not repeat any of these**. Skip project overview, skip commands, skip development conventions. Focus entirely on navigation and data flow.

### Step 1: Discover

Find entry points, top-level structure, and identify the primary language/framework. Skip generated code (`.gen.go`, migrations, ORM output, etc.).

### Step 2: Layered Mode Decision

Count non-generated source files — run `scripts/count_sources.sh [project_root]` (bundled with this skill) for a deterministic count, per-language breakdown, and layering hint, instead of eyeballing it. Add project-specific generated paths via `CODEMAP_EXCLUDE='regex'`. The thresholds:

- **≤ 50 files**: Use **single-layer mode** — generate everything in one `.claude/CODEMAP.md`
- **> 50 files**: Use **two-layer mode** — generate a top-level `.claude/CODEMAP.md` with module table + task index + dependency graph, then create `.claude/CODEMAP-<module>.md` for each core business module's detailed call chains

Two-layer mode structure:
```
.claude/CODEMAP.md                    # Top-level: modules, task index, dependencies (no global change log)
.claude/CODEMAP-auth.md               # auth module: call chains + that module's Change Log
.claude/CODEMAP-billing.md            # billing module: call chains + that module's Change Log
.claude/CODEMAP-proxy.md              # proxy module: call chains + that module's Change Log
```

### Step 3: Identify Core Business Modules

Don't list every directory. Identify the **business modules** — groups of files that serve a specific domain purpose. For each:

- **Responsibility**: 1 line what it does
- **Key files**: 2-4 file paths, each paired with its entry function name (no line numbers)
- **Key functions**: 2-3 function names that are the entry points

Example:
```
| 模块 | 职责 | 关键文件 | 入口函数 |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| AI 聊天 | 多模型路由 + SSE 转发 | `controller/aichat/default.go`, `service/aichatService/default.go`, `lib/utils/httputil/httputil.go` | `Completions()`, `AiChatFactory()`, `FlowHttpPost()` |
```

### Step 4: Build Task Index

For each major task a developer might want to do, list the files to edit — path + the **function/symbol** to touch (no line numbers) — plus **preconditions** and **pitfalls**:

```markdown
## Task Index

### To add a new AI provider
1. `internal/service/aichatService/default.go` → `AiChatFactory()` — add case, implement `ChatStreamModel` interface
2. `lib/utils/httputil/httputil.go` → `FlowHttpPost()` — add switch case, write `*HandleStreamResponse()`
3. `internal/consts/aiModel.go` → `ModelMapping` — add model constant, update `IsBailianModel()` if needed

**Precondition**: Confirm upstream API is OpenAI-compatible. If not, need custom request/response structs.
**Pitfall**: `FlowHttpPost` has no default fallback — new cases must be explicitly listed, or they fall through to `BailianHandleStreamResponse`.
```

Build this by tracing: where does the factory/registry live? where does the handler live? where are the types defined? For each task, ask: what must be true before this works? what edge case has burned someone before?

### Step 5: Trace Call Chains — Control Flow + Data Flow

Split call chains into two distinct types:

**Control Flow** (谁调谁 — explicit function calls):
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[CryptoCheck] --> B[Completions]
    B --> C[AiChatFactory]
    C --> D[BailianApi.ChatProcess]
    D --> E[FlowHttpPost]
    E --> F[SSE Forward]
```

**Data Flow** (数据怎么变 — where data is transformed):
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[加密请求体] --> B[SM4解密→明文JSON]
    B --> C[解析为CompletionsReq]
    C --> D[注入system prompt+城市]
    D --> E[序列化为DashScope请求]
    E --> F[SSE逐帧→AiOutput→flush]
    F --> G[客户端收到标准化响应]
```

**Parallel branches** (async/goroutine): Use Mermaid subgraphs or suffix labels like `G1[UpdateChatLog async]`.

**Tracing rules**:
- **Only trace explicit calls**: function A calls function B, switch case dispatch, interface implementation. Do NOT trace implicit calls (ORM hooks, decorators, reflection, event bus subscribers, middleware auto-registration).
- **If you can't find an explicit call, don't guess**: Omit that link rather than infer it. Better a shorter accurate chain than a longer misleading one.
- **Note gaps**: If a known runtime behavior (e.g., middleware order, ORM query) has no explicit source-level call, add a "未追踪" note under the diagram.

Each diagram ≤ 12 nodes — split at logical boundaries if needed. The 12-node limit is a readability heuristic, not a hard law: some flows are one cohesive chain (a linear pipeline where each step feeds the next) or a single decision tree whose branches only make sense together. Splitting those forces an artificial seam that hurts comprehension more than the length does. When a diagram is genuinely atomic like this, keep it whole and tag it with a no-split marker (see below) so future runs don't re-split it. Even then stay reasonable — past ~18 nodes the diagram itself is telling you the real flow is too tangled, and the fix is to simplify the code or the abstraction, not just the picture.

**Confidence labels**: After EACH diagram, add a line with confidence level AND a verification hint if not high:
- `<!-- confidence: high — explicit static calls only -->`
- `<!-- confidence: medium — inferred from naming convention → verify: grep "Register" in router/ to confirm handler binding -->`
- `<!-- confidence: low — inferred from runtime behavior, not found in source → verify: check middleware registration order in main.go -->`

This tells future Claude instances not just which diagrams to trust, but **where to verify** before acting on them.

**No-split marker**: When you deliberately keep a diagram whole despite exceeding the node limit, record why on the same comment-line style as confidence:
- `<!-- no-split: linear ingest→validate→enrich→persist pipeline; splitting would orphan the data dependency between steps -->`

This is a signal to future runs (and the trimming rules below): the size was a judgment call, not an oversight — respect it unless the underlying flow itself changed. A no-split note without a real reason is just an excuse to dump a tangled diagram; if you can't name why the flow is atomic, it probably isn't, and you should split it.

### Step 6: Generate the Document

Write to `.claude/CODEMAP.md` in the project root. Create the `.claude/` directory if it doesn't exist.

**Preserve human-authored content.** A live CODEMAP is co-maintained: people hand-add hard-won Pitfalls, invariants ("铁律"), and Preconditions that cannot be re-derived from source. When `.claude/CODEMAP.md` already exists, **back it up to `.claude/CODEMAP.md.bak` first**, then **never delete or rewrite anything inside a manual-protection marker**:

```
<!-- manual: keep — hand-authored, do not auto-rewrite -->
... human notes / pitfalls / invariants ...
<!-- /manual -->
```

Regenerate only the auto-traced sections (module table, call chains, dependency graph) *around* these blocks. When you add a Pitfall or invariant yourself that future runs must keep, wrap it in the same marker.

### Step 7: Wire into CLAUDE.md

After writing CODEMAP.md, **ensure CLAUDE.md references it** so future Claude instances load it automatically.

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` (root or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Check if it already contains a line instructing to read `.claude/CODEMAP.md`. If not, add one right after the project overview / before the first content section. The line should be:

```
**Before any code editing task, read `.claude/CODEMAP.md`** — it contains task-based file indexes, call chain diagrams, and module entry points you need to be productive.
```

Do NOT overwrite CLAUDE.md — only append this reference if it is missing.

### Step 8: Spot-check before trusting

Tracing call chains from source is exactly where an LLM hallucinates, so don't ship on self-rated confidence alone — **verify a sample before considering the map done**:

1. **High-confidence edges**: for every diagram tagged `confidence: high`, pick at least one edge (caller → callee) and confirm the call literally exists — `grep` the callee inside the caller's file/function. If it isn't there, fix the edge or downgrade the label. A `high` you never checked is a `medium` in disguise.
2. **Task Index symbols**: for each entry, confirm the named function/symbol still exists in the cited file (`scripts/where.sh <file> <symbol>` locates it). Drop entries whose symbol is gone.
3. **no-split markers**: confirm each `<!-- no-split -->` reason still matches the current flow.

Record what you actually checked under **Last Updated → Update checklist**, so the next run knows what was verified vs. assumed. Catching one fabricated call here is worth more than tracing ten more chains you never verify.

The output document follows this structure.

For **single-layer mode**:
```markdown
# [Project Name] — Code Map

**Location**: `.claude/CODEMAP.md`
Generated: [date]

## Core Business Modules

[Table: module | responsibility | key files | entry functions — ≤ 3 lines each, max 8 modules]

## Task Index

### [Task 1: e.g., "Add a new AI provider"]
[Numbered list of files to edit + the function/symbol to touch in each — no line numbers]

### [Task 2]
...

## Call Chains

### [Flow 1: e.g., "Chat request — control flow"]

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    [explicit function calls, ≤ 12 nodes]
```

<!-- confidence: high — explicit static calls only -->
<!-- blind spots: [what this chain doesn't cover — e.g., no retry mechanism, upstream timeout returns 502 directly, no integration test for this path] -->

### [Flow 2: e.g., "Chat request — data flow"]

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    [data transformations at each step, ≤ 12 nodes]
```

<!-- confidence: medium — inferred from naming convention → verify: grep "Register" in router/ -->
<!-- blind spots: [e.g., middleware execution order not traced, Flume async reporting lifecycle unknown] -->

### [Flow 3: e.g., "Model routing decision tree"]

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    [decision tree with branching — a tree whose branches share one entry condition can stay whole past 12 nodes if tagged no-split]
```

<!-- confidence: high — explicit switch case -->
<!-- no-split: single routing decision tree; branches share the same entry condition and lose meaning if separated -->

## Module Dependencies

```mermaid

    [compact dependency graph — ≤ 12 nodes, split into subgraphs if needed]
```

[Brief: which modules are hubs, which are leaves, any notable circular dependencies]

## Change Log

Not kept in this file — see **"Where the Change Log lives"** below. The main `CODEMAP.md` carries navigation only; the log is offloaded to `CODEMAP-changelog.md` (single-layer) or each `CODEMAP-<module>.md` (two-layer).

## Last Updated

- **Generated**: [date]
- **Codebase state**: [brief description]
- **Known gaps**: [what wasn't covered]
- **Update checklist**: [items to check next time the skill runs]
```

For **two-layer mode**, the top-level `.claude/CODEMAP.md` omits call chains (replaced by links to per-module files), and each `.claude/CODEMAP-<module>.md` contains that module's detailed diagrams **plus that module's own Change Log section**.

## Where the Change Log lives

The Change Log is **not** kept in the main `CODEMAP.md`. The main file is read before every coding task (for navigation), but the log is only consulted when re-running the skill or auditing history — so it's offloaded to keep navigation reads lean:

- **single-layer** → one file `.claude/CODEMAP-changelog.md`
- **two-layer** → no global log; each business change is recorded in **its module's own** `.claude/CODEMAP-<module>.md` (e.g. a billing change → the `## Change Log` section at the bottom of `CODEMAP-billing.md`). A cross-cutting change is logged under whichever module owns its entry point.

Each log file/section uses this format and rules:

```
| Date | Business Area | Change |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 2026-05-13 | Initial | CODEMAP created — AI chat routing, billing, agent system |
| 2026-06-01 | 计费 | PostConsume 新增企业成员共享池扣减分支（billing_service.go PostConsume） |
```

**Rules:**
- **Change**: state what business logic changed and **name the core function/symbol** whose behavior changed ("PostConsume 新增企业成员共享池扣减分支") — pin the delta to an entry point. **Name the function, never a line number**: the log is historical, so a line number recorded today is meaningless once the code moves, whereas a function name stays greppable. Never log the analysis action ("traced X", "analyzed Y").
- **Keep the most recent 20 entries per log file/section**; when trimming, drop oldest first — older ones fold into that file's `Last Updated` summary.
- Wrap a milestone entry in `<!-- manual -->` to exempt it from trimming.

## Managing CODEMAP Growth

CODEMAP.md grows over time as the project evolves. To prevent context bloat:

**Change Log with delta comparison**: Before analyzing, read the last entry of the relevant log — `.claude/CODEMAP-changelog.md` (single-layer) or the `## Change Log` section of each `CODEMAP-<module>.md` (two-layer). Compare the current codebase against what was recorded last time. Append one row per changed business area capturing the **difference** — new functions, new routes, modified rules, removed features. If a business area is unchanged, write nothing for it. Only record actual deltas, not re-tracing the same code.

Example of good delta entries (name the function, never a line number):
- "AiChatFactory 新增 `OpenRouter` case，handler 为 `httputil.go` 的 `OpenRouterHandleStreamResponse`"
- "`billing_service.go` PostConsume 新增企业成员共享池扣减分支"
- "CompletionsV2 IntentType 路由新增 case 7 → 语音模型"

Example of bad entries:
- "分析了 AiChatFactory 函数"（这是动作，不是变化）
- "CODEMAP 更新了"（这是空话，没说变了什么）

**Section-aware threshold**: When `.claude/CODEMAP.md` exceeds 200 lines, trim as below — but **anything inside a `<!-- manual -->` block is exempt from every trimming rule here**:
1. **Change Log**: now lives in `CODEMAP-changelog.md` / per-module files, not here — trim each to the most recent 20 entries (oldest fold into that file's `Last Updated` summary).
2. **Call Chains**: If a single flow diagram exceeds 15 nodes, split it into two diagrams (sync vs async) — **unless it carries a `<!-- no-split: ... -->` marker**, in which case leave it whole and trust the recorded reason (only re-evaluate if the underlying flow changed). If a module has > 3 diagrams in total, move that module to a separate `CODEMAP-<module>.md` file and replace with a link.
3. **Core Business Modules**: Never trim this table — it's the primary navigation anchor. If > 10 modules, split rarely-used ones into a "扩展模块" subsection.
4. **Task Index**: Keep all entries. If an entry references a deleted file, remove it.
5. **Module Dependencies**: Keep one diagram. Never duplicate.

**Never full-rewrite over human content**: Even when `.claude/CODEMAP.md` is large or stale, do NOT blow the whole file away. Always work incrementally: back up to `.claude/CODEMAP.md.bak`, keep every `<!-- manual -->` block **verbatim**, and re-scan only the auto-generated sections (module table, call chains, dependency graph) around them. If while re-scanning you spot a human-added Pitfall/invariant that isn't yet wrapped in a `<!-- manual -->` block, **wrap it in one rather than letting the re-scan drop it** — don't silently overwrite knowledge that's expensive to recover. If the auto-generated sections themselves have grown unwieldy, split modules into `CODEMAP-<module>.md` rather than deleting.

**Auto-trigger via script**: On every run, run `scripts/check_size.sh [.claude] [200]` to see which `CODEMAP*.md` files exceed the threshold. For each flagged OVER: move detailed call chains into `CODEMAP-<module>.md`, and keep Change Log entries in `CODEMAP-changelog.md` (single-layer) or the owning `CODEMAP-<module>.md` (two-layer), ≤ 20 per log. The script only measures size — what content moves where is your call from its output, and `<!-- manual -->` blocks always stay put.

## Tips

The Process steps above are the detail; these are the four things that most often get dropped:

- **Never repeat CLAUDE.md**: skip anything it already covers (overview, commands, conventions); spend the space on navigation and data flow.
- **Task Index is the most important section**: developers search by task first — keep it precise (file path + function name) with preconditions and pitfalls, not just "edit these files".
- **Anchor on file path + function name, never a line number**: write `controller/aichat/default.go → Completions()`. A stored line number decays the moment code moves; when you want a line, compute it fresh with `scripts/where.sh <file> <symbol>`.
- **Add blind spots**: after each Call Chain, note what it does NOT cover (no retry, no test, upstream-timeout behavior) — the gaps matter as much as the chain.
